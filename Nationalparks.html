    <h1>National parks (In California) </h1>
    <h2>Channel Islands National Park</h2>
    <p> Often called the "Galapagos of North America," this park encompasses
        five remote, isolated islands off the coast of Southern California. 
        Due to thousands of years of isolation, it features remarkable biodiversity
        with unique plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth, such as the 
        island fox and island scrub jay. The surrounding marine sanctuary boasts abundant sea life, 
        including seals, sea lions, dolphins, and migrating whales, with vibrant kelp forests perfect 
        for snorkeling and diving.

    <h2>Death Valley National Park</h2>
    <p>This is a land of extremes, known as the hottest, driest, and lowest elevation national park in
        the United States. It features a starkly beautiful, surreal desert landscape with unique geological
        formations like the Badwater Basin, which is 282 feet below sea level. The park also contains the 
        largest protected wilderness area in the contiguous US, offering a quiet escape with vast salt flats, 
        colorful badlands, and towering sand dunes.

    <h2>Joshua Tree National Park</h2>
    <p>This park is renowned for its namesake, a dynamic and unusual-looking plant called the Joshua tree,
        and its nearly surreal desert landscapes. It's a popular destination for rock climbing and features 
        a unique intersection of two vast desert ecosystems, the Mojave and the Colorado. The rugged rock 
        formations and stark desert scenery create a unique environment that is particularly famous for its 
        spectacular dark night skies and vibrant sunsets.

    <h2>Kings Canyon National Park</h2>
    <p>Administered jointly with Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon features one of the deepest canyons
     in North America, high mountain meadows, and granite peaks rising over 14,000 feet. The park is a haven 
     for backcountry wilderness exploration, known for its swift-flowing rivers and massive stands of giant sequoia
      trees in areas like the General Grant Grove.

    <h2>Lassen Volcanic National Park</h2>
    <p>This park is one of the few places in the world where all four types of volcanoes can be found, 
        featuring steaming fumaroles, boiling mud pots, and hot springs that continue to shape the land. Jagged peaks, 
        clear mountain lakes, and wildflower-filled meadows provide a striking backdrop for hiking and exploration in
        this geologically active area.

    <h2>Pinnacles National Park</h2>
    <p>California's newest national park, Pinnacles was formed from the remnants of an ancient volcanic field that has
         eroded into a unique landscape of rocky spires and deep canyons. Located in Central California, the park is a 
         prime location for hiking and rock climbing and serves as a critical protected release site for the endangered 
         California condor, offering visitors a chance to see these magnificent birds in the wild.

    <h2>Redwood National and State Parks</h2>
    <p>Renowned for protecting nearly half of all remaining old-growth coastal redwoods, the tallest trees on Earth, 
        this network of federal and state parks offers landscapes spanning from open prairies to untamed coastline and 
        pristine rivers. The National Park Service and California State Parks work together to manage this precious resource, 
        which has supported human life for thousands of years and is a designated World Heritage Site.
