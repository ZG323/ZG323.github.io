    <h1>Wildlife (Animals and Plants) </h1>
    <h2>Animals</h2>
    <p>Animal safety in the wild hinges primarily on the preservation of natural habitats and the mitigation of human-caused threats. 
        As human development expands, wildlife faces challenges like habitat fragmentation, pollution, and increased vehicle collisions. 
        Conservation efforts are crucial, focusing on establishing protected areas, creating wildlife crossings over busy highways, and enforcing anti-poaching laws. 
        Individual actions also play a vital role; properly disposing of litter prevents entanglement or ingestion of harmful materials, and limiting the use of pesticides safeguards 
        entire ecosystems from toxic runoff. Responsible ecotourism guidelines encourage observing animals from a safe distance without interference, allowing them to forage
         and behave naturally in their environment.</p>
         
    <p>For human visitors entering wild spaces, safety for both people and animals depends on mutual respect and caution. Park services and wildlife management agencies stress the 
        importance of following the "leave no trace" principles and never feeding wild animals. Approaching or feeding wildlife habituates them to humans, which often leads to dangerous 
        encounters and requires the relocation or euthanasia of the animal involved. Hikers and campers should secure food in bear-proof containers, carry bear spray where appropriate, 
        and keep pets leashed to prevent conflicts. By maintaining distance and minimizing presence, humans protect themselves from unpredictable animal behavior while allowing wild 
        creatures to thrive without disruption.
    </p>

    <h2>"Leave No Trace" Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Plan Ahead and Prepare: Know the regulations and special concerns for the area you're visiting, prepare for extreme weather, schedule your trip to 
            avoid busy times, and repackage food to minimize waste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces: Stick to established trails and campsites, walk single file in the middle of the trail, and camp at least 
            200 feet away from water sources (lakes and streams).
        </li>
        <li>
            Dispose of Waste Properly: Pack it in, pack it out, including all trash, food scraps, and toilet paper.
             Deposit solid human waste in catholes dug 6 to 8 inches deep and at least 200 feet from water, camp, and trails.
        </li>
        <li>
            Leave What You Find: Preserve the past by examining but not touching cultural artifacts, and leave rocks, plants, and other natural objects
             as you find them. Do not build structures or dig trenches.
        </li>
        <li>
            Minimize Campfire Impacts: Use a lightweight stove for cooking and use established fire rings where fires are permitted.
             Keep fires small, use only dead and downed wood that can be broken by hand, and ensure the fire is completely extinguished and cool to the touch before leaving.
        </li>
        <li>
            Respect Wildlife: Observe animals from a distance and never feed them, as human food damages their health and alters their natural behaviors. 
            Store food and trash securely and control pets at all times.
        </li>
        <li>
            Be Considerate of Other Visitors: Respect the quality of other people's experience by keeping noise levels down, yielding to others on the trail 
            (uphill hikers generally have the right of way), and taking breaks away from trails and other campsites
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Plants</h2>

    <p>While all plants serve a vital role in Earth's ecosystems, some possess potent 
        toxins as a natural defense mechanism against animals and insects. These 
        poisonous plants can cause a wide range of harm to humans and pets, from simple
        skin irritation to severe organ failure or death, depending on the plant and amount
        ingested. The toxins vary; some cause an immediate reaction, while others have delayed, 
        but fatal, effects. Common contact irritants in North America include poison ivy, poison 
        oak, and poison sumac, all of which contain the oil urushiol that causes an allergic rash.
