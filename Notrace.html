   <h2>"Leave No Trace" Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Plan Ahead and Prepare: Know the regulations and special concerns for the area you're visiting, prepare for extreme weather, schedule your trip to 
            avoid busy times, and repackage food to minimize waste.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces: Stick to established trails and campsites, walk single file in the middle of the trail, and camp at least 
            200 feet away from water sources (lakes and streams).
        </li>
        <li>
            Dispose of Waste Properly: Pack it in, pack it out, including all trash, food scraps, and toilet paper.
             Deposit solid human waste in catholes dug 6 to 8 inches deep and at least 200 feet from water, camp, and trails.
        </li>
        <li>
            Leave What You Find: Preserve the past by examining but not touching cultural artifacts, and leave rocks, plants, and other natural objects
             as you find them. Do not build structures or dig trenches.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Minimize Campfire Impacts: Use a lightweight stove for cooking and use established fire rings where fires are permitted.
             Keep fires small, use only dead and downed wood that can be broken by hand, and ensure the fire is completely extinguished and cool to the touch before leaving.
        </li>
        <li>
            Respect Wildlife: Observe animals from a distance and never feed them, as human food damages their health and alters their natural behaviors. 
            Store food and trash securely and control pets at all times.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Be Considerate of Other Visitors: Respect the quality of other people's experience by keeping noise levels down, yielding to others on the trail 
            (uphill hikers generally have the right of way), and taking breaks away from trails and other campsites
        </li>
