    <h2>Reason for this website</h2>
    <p>I created this Website because I wanted visitors to know basic information about famous National
        Parks in California, and basic wildlife information to go out into nature with a basic understanding
        so you keep yourself and surroundings safe: I wish I had a website like this before I got into camping and exploring nature,
        because it is very hard to learn new things in the moment and it is so much better
        to be prepared.
